### Introduction

Throughout this sprint you have been down in the trenches building features, delivering those features to real uses, gathering feedback, and using that feedback to inform on decisions about the future of your product.

This is all a part of the bigger picture as you have learned how to effectively not only deliver features as a part of a cross functional team, but you've **learned how to work together to do so.** At this point, it's fair to say that you're more than capable of performing the technical duties that the job market demands and now we want to focus and hear from you about how you've been working as **an effective member of a team.**

### Prompt 1

- What sorts of strengths do _you_ bring to the team as a contributor in your role? List out anything that highlights how you've helped push this project along.
I have specialized heavily in UI. My strength in this area has been the ability to implement new styling while maintaining current logical functionality. 
- What are some of your weaknesses as a member of your team? How have you worked to overcome some of your individual weaknesses? Be specific.

- How is your team measuring the success of your product? How do you know you are solving user problems? How are you using these measurements to inform what to build next?
